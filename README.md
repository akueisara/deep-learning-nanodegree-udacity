## Project 1 - [Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network)](https://github.com/akueisara/deep-learning-nanodegree-udacity/blob/master/project-bikesharing/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb)

- Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals. 
- The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Project 2 - [CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/akueisara/deep-learning-nanodegree-udacity/blob/master/project-dog/dog_app.ipynb)

- Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
